## About
WorkFlo is a project management web application that allows the user to collaborate with others during the project development phase. The web app offers a drag and drop feature which improves the users experience through its effortless organization performance and functionality. WorkFlo offers a set of tools that optimizes coordination including real-time chat and leveraging the Excalidraw website.

We built this web app to help organize the initial phase of project production by keeping all of the architectural references in one single place. We wanted to make the development process easier to navigate by avoiding flipping through multiple websites for different pieces of information.
